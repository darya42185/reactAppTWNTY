Decisions I made during development:

1. For state management, I chose the Redux toolkit instead of the classic Redux, because the createStore function is already outdated
2. To write styles, I used the css modules approach
3. Tried to make the application as realistic as possible. For example, the user cannot select more items for the cart than are available from the API, from the order form the user can go back to the cart and change the order, also added fields validation.
4. Added typing using Typescript
